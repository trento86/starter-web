Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I'm going to buy you the single healthiest call girl this town has ever seen. Talk you off what, Pop Pop? I will pack your sweet pink mouth with so much ice cream you'll be the envy of every Jerry and Jane on the block! Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Am I in two thirds of a hospital room?
